# **M2-Embedded_DCtoDC_Converter**

## ***Direct Current to Direct Current Boost conversion of Closed Loop System***

The purpose of the project is to build a DC to DC Boost Converter based on Atmega328 microcontroller. Basically, DC-DC converters are devices which change one level of direct current/ voltage to another (either higher or lower) level.

A DC-to-DC boost converter circuit is a circuit that can convert a DC voltage into a larger DC voltage. So, for example, you may be able to convert a 5V DC voltage into 30V. A DC-to-DC converter works on the principle of an inductor primarily and a capacitor.

# *Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcame*

* Having some installation issues in SimulIDE and tried to overcame by troubleshooting videos, and has a problem in Loading the firmware and by no way done in other simulink software.

### *Project Title chosen*
* First chosen an LED banner project with 8*8 display, having some issues in hex file and chosen a Digital Voltmeter, then taking research with this project.
